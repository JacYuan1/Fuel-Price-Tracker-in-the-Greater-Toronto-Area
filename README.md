# Fuel Price Tracker in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
This project is a Python script designed to monitor and track price changes in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Utilizing Selenium WebDriver for web scraping, the script extracts the current, previous, and upcoming prices and processes the data to determine the price trend. It then sends formatted notifications to a Discord channel via a webhook. This script can be scheduled to run at desired intervals (using Windows Task Scheduler), providing timely updates on price fluctuations aiding in informed decision-making.
